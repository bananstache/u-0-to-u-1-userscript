# u0 to u1 userscript
this is a userscript that automatically redirects you from google links with user0 to user1. 
as an example, it takes you from 
https://docs.google.com/presentation/u/0/
over to 
https://docs.google.com/presentation/u/1/

currently, this works on:
gmail
google docs
google slides
google forms
google sheets
google classroom
google drive
google maps

this does NOT work on the default google search enginge
